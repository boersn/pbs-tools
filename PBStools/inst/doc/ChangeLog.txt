	- Modified queries to include depth information.
  • Changed the call to six modern catch databases to use the single table `GF_MERGED_CATCH' from the `GFFOS' database via `fos_mcatORF.sql'. (RH 150414)
  • Changed calls from `require' to `requireNamespace' as requested by CRAN's R check. Fixed othe R check issues. (RH 150306)

	Note that 13 fields in the longline skate and set data overlap and there are 4 fields in each set that are not found in the other:
	skates: c("FE_PARENT_EVENT_ID","FE_SUB_LEVEL_ID","FE_MINOR_LEVEL_ID","LGLSP_HOOK_COUNT")
	setd  : c("START_LONGITUDE", "END_LONGITUDE", "START_LATITUDE", "END_LATITUDE")
  - Changed the name of `gfb_iphc_hooks.sql' to `gfb_iphc_hook_data.sql' to align with AME's data naming. (RH 150304)
  - Forgot to add update `gfb_catch_records.sql' (modified 140714) into the package. (RH 150303)
  - Modified `buildCatch' to exclude seamounts -- easier than doing it in all the queries. (RH 150219)
	Reversed the changes to `fos_vcatORF.sql' made on 150218.
  - Changed SQL query `fos_vcatORF.sql' to exclude seamount catches. (RH 150218)
  - changed SQL query `pht_map_density.sql' to include a gear code. (RH 150106)
  - Bumped up version for 2015.

1.26  2014-12-12
  - Fixed a bug (recently introduced -- Oct 2014?) in `buildCatch' that affected YYR reconstruction (first year for fid=4:5 is 1982 not 1956). (RH 141212)
  - Added query `gfb_jcatORF.sql' for `buildCatch' (forgot in subversion 31). (RH 141212)
  - Added new argument `dpath' to `buildCatch' specifying a database path for times when user wants to build alternative catch histories (in another directory) using data already queried. (RH 141209)
  - Added query `gfb_iphc_hooks.sql' to get IPHC hook data (2003-present) for AME to develop an IPHC survey index series. (RH 141017)
  - Modified various queries for `buildCtach' to return `locality' codes. (RH 141015)
  - Modified function `getData' to handle subqueries for SQL account holders (no DFO credenntials, thanks Chris G). (RH 141007)
  - Modified function `showError' to keep track of when an error message is displayed on the device using `setPBSoptions("showError",TRUE)'. (RH 141007)
  - Added an option to calculate RRF/ORF (RRF/TRF) using the binomial-gamma. (RH 141002)
  - Modified functions `weightBio' to recognise gear type and `texArray' to address a small bug and add custom column header labels. (RH 141002)
  - Modified query `fos_vcatORF.sql' to use calculated mean weights from GFBioSQL rather than calculating them from data in GFFOS. (RH 140908)
  - Added new query `gfb_mean_weight.sql' to calculate the mean weight of a fish species from GFBioSQL to convert discarded pieces to kg in GFFOS. (RH 140905)
	Based on Paul Starr's algorithm.
  - Modified function `buildCatch' to incorporate species-specific catches not represented in the modern catch databases. (RH 140825)
	Also added a new argument `useYR1' to specifying a starting year (one for each fishery) that credible landing data is available (e.g., 1967 for YTR, 1956 for POP).
  - Renamed module `M08_texCrap.r' to `M08_LaTeX.r'. (RH 140819)
  - Modified  function `buildCatch' to accept extra parameters through `...'; specifically to allow introduction of modified trawl ratios of RRF/TRF and RRF/ORF. (RH 140818)
	These ratios form the first row of the function matrix object `gamma'.
	PJS calculated reference ratios of YTR/TRF and YTR/ORF that exclude midwater trawls and use only the offshore localities withinn PMFCs rather than the entire PMFCs.
	The alteration to `gamma' should only be a temporary measure; the code should calculate these variations automatically, if chosen, but will not be implemented right away.
  - Added new field to `gfb_bio.sql' query -- `narc' = NOT_AVAILABLE_REASON_CODE in table B05a_Specimen_Collected. (RH 140815)
  - Modified functions `getCatch', `mapMaturity', `cacLenWt', `calcVB', `estOgive', `weightBio', `texArray', and `formatCatch' to further automate building CSAP RD's `Appendix D. Biology' using Sweave. (RH 8/13)
  - Updated functions `calcLenWt', `calcVB', `mapMaturity', and `estOgive'; can now yield user-defined output names for easier building of Sweave documents. (RH 140709)
  - Updated function `texArray', which had actually been revised in Aug 2013 but not incorporated into package. (RH 140709)
  - Updated SQL code `gfb_rcatORF.sql' to include `SVID' and `SSID` fields. (RH 140708)
  - Updated function `formatCatch' to deal with `cast_df' class objects. (RH 140708)
  - Updated functions `calcLenWt' and `calcVB' for better visual output. (RH 140704)
  - Created new function `surveyCatch' to call query `gfb_rcatORF.sql' and produce a summary table of survey catch for a specified species. (RH 140703)
  - Modified the SQL query `gfb_bio.sql' to better identify Surevy Series ID (SSID) and to ignore Fishing Event IDs (FEID) that describe individual hooks and traps. (RH 140702)
  - Modified the SQL query `fos_vcatORF.sql' and the function `buildCatch' to use the SQL Server database GFFOS. (RH 140702)
  - Modified the function `getCatch' to query the GFFOS database on the SVBCPBSGFIIS server. (RH 140624)
  - Modified four SQL queries called by `getCatch' -- `gfb_catch_records.sql', `gfc_catch_records.sql', `pht_catch_records.sql', `fos_catch_records.sql'. (RH 140623)
  - Updated SQL code to handle R-3.1.0's large-precision nonsense; specific files:
	`fos_catch_records.sql', `gfb_bio.sql', `gfb_fos_catch.sql', `gfb_pht_catch.sql', `gfb_age_request.sql',
	`pht_tcatORF.sql', `phhl_hcatORF.sql', `phhl_vcatORF.sql', `phhl_fcatORF.sql'.
  - Updated functions `glimmer' (pht_glm.sql) and `showIndices' (gfb_boot.sql) to handle R-3.1.0's new (and stupid) handling of large-precision numbers. (RH 140508)
  - Wrapped calls to `win.metafile' with a call to `do.call' to avoid Rcheck NOTES about platform-specific devices. (RH 140414)
  - Imported `PBSmapping', `PBSmodelling', `PBSdat', and `RODBC' in NAMESPACE file, as per Rcheck instructions. (RH 140414)
	(The message in R-exts.pdf: ``Packages declared in the `Depends' field should not also be in the `Imports' field'' must only pertain to the DESCRIPTION file.)

  - Added new function `getODBC' to get a list of the ODBC drivers on a user's Windows system. (RH 130626)
  - Modified function `.getSQLdata' to use the Oracle ODBC driver `Oracle in OraClient11g_home1' instead of `Oracle ODBC Driver`. (RH 130625)
	User can still specify alternative SQL\Oracle drivers by passing, for example, `driver="Oracle ODBC Driver"' through the function `getData`.
  - Moved object `.PBSserver' form the `sql' directory to the `R' directory in `M01_Utility.r`. (RH 130508)
  - Updated script `Rqpdf.bat' to utilize ghostcript's `gswin32c.exe' AND QPDF's `qpdf.exe', paralleling the process in tools::compactPDF. (RH 130508)
  - Added two new functions to manipulate files: `countLines' and `subsetFile`. (RH 130508)

  - Requires R-3.0.0 (RH 130429)

1.24  2013-04-04
  - Fixed bug in function `trend' -- specifically in function `.trend.trendy' where object `ttlist' was created with `sapply' and `simplify' was NOT set to `FALSE`. (RH 130404)
  - Modified function `trend' -- fixed bugs, updated the GUI, added support for multiple image file formats. (RH 130403)
  - Modified SQL queries to Oracle via SQL Server using variable format `@~sppcode' rather than `@sppcode`; this inserts two single-quote delimiters rather than one. (RH 130320)
  - Modified function `buildCatch' to stitch together EPS barplot results using the function `collectFigs`. (RH 130315)
  - Modified function `getData' to handle multiple species substitutions in SQL code that queries Oracle databases via OPENQUERY in SQL Server. (RH 130314)
  - Added new function `plotTertiary' to plot compositional data of n-dimensions into a polygonal shape with n sides. (RH 130313)
  - Modified function `clarify' to allow user to specify land mass colour. (RH 130312)
  - Added some new SQL queries to return catch data for cluster analysis via CLARA in the function `clarify`. (RH 130311)
  - Added function `plotTernary' to plot ternary diagrams of data that have been grouped into three categories. (RH 130307)
  - Modified function `plotGMA' to allow a bit more flexibility in adding extra labels. (RH 130226)
  - Modified function `requestAges' to display random samples by storage ID (sample box : otolith tray) rather than by sample ID. (RH 130221)
	The issue arose because in surveys recently, biologists have been taking many samples of few fish rather than few samples of many fish.

1.23  2013-02-14
  - Modified function `requestAges' to deal with many samples where selected number of otoliths is less than 1. (RH 130214)
  - Debugged function `imputeRate' where control objects were out of focus. (RH 130201)
  - Changed the package's general storage object from `PBSfish' to `PBStool`. (RH 130128)

  - Modified function `clarify' to use species names in the legend label. (RH 130121)
  - Debugged functions to finalise retro-fitting, at least enough to pass Rcheck (sans CRAN flag). (RH 130118)
  - Modified functions `getData' and `getFile' to specify which environment the results should be sent to. (RH 130117)
  - Retrofit the code to move the working list `PBSfish' to the working environment `.PBStoolEnv`. (RH 130117)
  - Uploaded an intermediate build. Problems exist because PBStools is highly entwined with PBSmodelling before the latter was retro-fitted with the new working environment `.PBSmodEnv.' (RH 130116)
  - Added a new working environment called `.PBStoolEnv`. (RH 130116)
  - Added function `collectFigs' to collect encapsulated postscript files into one document using latex. (RH 130116)
  - Added new query `pht_map_catch.sql' (modified slightly from `pht_map_density.sql`) to gather catch by GMU areas, in addition to PMFC areas. (RH 130114)
  - Modified function `clarify' to save figures as encapsulated postscript `.eps' files. (RH 130110)
  - Modified function `getData' to recognise taxonomic groups. (RH 130110)
  - Modified 'buildCatch' to fix a bug in allocating catch from unknown areas to PMFC major areas. (RH 121121)
  - Further modified 'buildCatch' to finish diagnostic plots (using 'plotData') and to call 'plotRecon' for final output barplots. (RH 121120)
  - Modified function 'requestAges' and SQL query 'gfb_age_request.sql' to deal with requests that span years with no grouping code. (RH 121115)
  - Added diagnostic plots to see data for catch reconstruction. (RH 121114)

1.22  2012-10-03
  - Added new function 'formatCatch' to format tables by transforming numeric values to strings that display significant digits. (RH 121003) 
  - Added new function 'makeLTH' to make longtable headers for printing xtables in Sweave. (RH 120927)

	'door' (doorspread in m), 'area' (survey stratum area), and 'density' (catch density = catch/(dist*door*0.001)).
	Also change field names: 'group' -> 'GC' (survey grouping code) and 'Bwt' -> temp (bottom water temperature). (RH 120803)
  - Disabled mapping in 'runModules' to avoid circularity in package requirements. (RH 120716)
  - Disabled NOTES about 'no visible binding for '<<-'' by converting the assignment lines to evaluated text. (RH 120716)
  - Implemented Brian Ripley's suggestion to remove NOTES about 'no visible binding for global variable xxx':
	if(getRversion() >= "2.15.1") globalVariables(names=c(...), package="PBSmapx") (RH 120716)
  - Submitted to CRAN, but rejected by Dr. Brian Ripley. (RH 120713)
  - Added 'jss.bst' and 'jss.cls' to the 'vignettes' directory to enforce bibliography execution. (RH 120713)

PBSfishery History
==================
1.21  2012-04-17  Authors
  - Removed data objects as they now reside in a separate package called 'PBSdata'. (RH 120417)

1.20  2012-02-27  Authors
  - Added new argument `leg.font' to `par.map' to allow user to change the font parameter of the legend (still uses `mono' family). (RH 120227)
  - Wrapped the events information in the legend if minimum vessels/cell > 1. (RH 120227)
  - Revised `requestAges' to allow argument `nfree' to select otoliths from samples with minimum number of otoliths. (RH 120227)
  - Removed `GLOP' button from map GUI and added `GOP' (grid over plot) and `LOP' (land over plot) buttons. (RH 120223)
  - Added two new `par.map' values called `tit.loc' and `leg.loc' to give the user some control on title and legend placement - requested by Paul Starr. (RH 120221)
  - Added new button on map GUI called `par.map' to allow the user to see and change extra par values. (RH 120221)
  - Added small subfuction `.map.checkLims' to `M01_Map.r' to check that data limit GUI inputs are strictly increasing. (RH 120217)
  - Added new SQL query `fos_checklist_catch.sql' to provide retained and discarded catches for DFO's checklist. (RH 120216)
  - Modified functions `trackComp', `plotDiversity', and `boxSeason' to use local files/objects if available. (RH 111205)
  - R-2.14.0 appears to implement windows buffering, which can screw the interactive nature of `map'.
	Code now sets `windows.options(buffered=FALSE)' then resets it back to the user's original setting with an `onclose=.map.exit' in the GUI. (RH 111114)
  - Used `packageStartupMessage' rather than `cat' in `.onLoad' in `zzz.r'. (RH 111114)
  - Resaved the `.rda' data files using compress = "bzip2". (RH 111114)
  - Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. via R CMD check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata. (RH 111114)

1.19  2011-11-09  Authors
