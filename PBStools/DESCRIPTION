Description: A refreshing assortment of tools for exploring data from
   fisheries and other realms. While the focus is on providing efficient
   yet vivacious summary tools for fisheries stock assessments and 
   species at risk reports, occasional flights of fancy will elevate
   mundane information to Uranus.
